In the world of finance, diversification and risk management are cornerstones for investors. Investment funds offer an avenue to achieve these goals, allowing individuals to pool their money into a set of professionally managed investments. But how do these funds differ, and what is the structure behind each? A recent educational diagram from Josh Aharonoff from 2023 offers a clear and concise look at the different types of investment funds and how they work.

### Private Funds: Flexibility vs. Liquidity

Private funds, which include hedge funds, venture capital, private equity, and credit funds, are notable for their lighter regulation compared to registered funds. These funds are typically available only to accredited investors and offer a broader range of investment strategies. However, they often have higher investment requirements and offer less liquidity, meaning investors cannot withdraw their money at any time.

### Registered Funds: Access and Liquidity for the Average Investor

On the other hand, registered funds, such as investment funds, index funds, ETFs, and REITs, must provide same-day liquidity, making them more accessible to the average investor. These funds follow strict regulations and are designed to track market indexes or invest in a variety of assets, allowing investors to diversify their portfolios with ease.
